                    Fixed broadband subscriptions is an important measure used to track how internet
                    access has changed across the globe. It refers to fixed subscriptions to high-speed access to the
                    public Internet (specifically those at downstream speeds greater than or equal to 256
                    kilobits per second). This includes cable modem, DSL, fiber-to-the-home/building,
                    other fixed (wired)-broadband subscriptions, satellite broadband and terrestrial fixed wireless
                    broadband.
                    It excludes subscriptions that have access to data communications
                    (including the Internet) via mobile-cellular networks.
                    It includes both residential subscriptions and subscriptions for organizations

                Internet access increases as cost of internet decreases. As the circles grow larger
                (indicating increased access), they tend to be greener (indicating decreased cost).
                In areas with high proportions of low-income countries, such as Africa and the Americas,
                we still find relatively <span class="red-color">high internet cost</span>,
                while high-income areas, such as in Europe,
                have <span class="green-color">low cost of internet</span>. Interestingly, CIS countries (Azerbaijan, Armenia,
                Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine)
                have some of the lowest cost of internet in the world, and also have fairly high access, and accordingly fairly high access,
                although some countries with higher cost of internet have higher levels of access. Thus, it is important to note that the regional
                government and culture also play a role in internet access in a particular nation
